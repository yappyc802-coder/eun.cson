                <h2>Section 1: Understanding CSS and its Purposes</h2>
                <p>
                CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and design web pages. It defines how HTML elements appear on screen, paper, or other media,
                making websites more visually appealing and easier to maintain. CSS separates content from design, allowing developers to reuse one stylesheet for multiple
                pages, which saves time and ensures consistency. It improves accessibility, enhances layout and colors, and makes web pages responsive to different devices.
                Basic knowledge of HTML is needed before learning CSS since it works hand-in-hand with it to create complete and interactive websites.

                <h2>Section 2: Structure and Benefits</h2>
                <p> A webpage has three main layers: <strong>Content (HTML) </strong> for text and media, <strong> Presentation (CSS) </strong>for design and layout, and <strong>Behavior (JavaScript)</strong> for user interaction.
                The content layer builds the structure, the presentation layer focuses on how elements appear, and the behavior layer manages real-time interactions. CSS offers
                several benefits such as saving development time, allows faster page loading, provides easier maintenance, and improves flexibility in design. With CSS, web designers
                can position, layer, and style elements freely, creating cleaner and more organized webpages that enhance user experience.</p>
